# Kickstarter Analysis 
Performing an analysis on Kickstarter dataset that will show us trends based on specific factors that makes the campaigns successful.
## Overview of the Project
Louise is an upcoming play writer who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever" for which she is estimating a budget of $10,000. She wants us to help her determine the specific factors that makes her campaigns successful.
## The Purpose of This Analysis
I need to provide a visual representation feedback to Louise with insights to help her gain a better understanding of her campaigns from start to finish. This report will aid her to set her campaign to mirror other campaigns that are successful in the same category.
## Analysis and Challenges
In the Kickstarter raw data I sorted and prepared for the analysis by creating new columns to show parent category, subcategory, Average Donation, convert dates, convert times, and a new column for the year of the Launched date.
