# Kickstarter Analysis 
Performing an analysis on Kickstarter dataset that will show us trends based on specific factors that makes the campaigns successful.
## Overview of the Project
Louise is an upcoming play writer who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever" for which she is estimating a budget of $10,000. She wants us to help her determine the specific factors that makes her campaigns successful.
## The Purpose of This Analysis
I need to provide a visual representation feedback to Louise with insights to help her gain a better understanding of her campaigns from start to finish. This report will aid her to set her campaign to mirror other campaigns that are successful in the same category.
## Analysis and Challenges
In the Kickstarter raw data I sorted and prepared for the analysis by creating new columns to show parent category, subcategory, Average Donation, convert dates, convert times, and a new column for the year of the Launched date.

- The following chart is based on the Outcomes of the Parent Category. This shows that Theater was the most successful overall. Whene I filtered Theater by United States and Great Britain campaigns. US had a total of 525 successful Theater kickstarters campaign and GB had a total of 258 successful Theater kickstarters campaign.

## Difficulties and Challenges Encountered
- I faced some difficulties with the pivot table. Later, I realized where the error was and ammended the pivot table.
- I faced a lot of challenges using the CountIfs() formular. Read the questions asked in slack about it, and the video resources in the challange.
- The line chart I created didn't look like the sample given. Did some research and found and fixed the errors


# Kickstarter Challenge Results
# Conclusions Drawn for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
Looking at the line graph below, we can see a detailed trend. May and June had a relatively high number of Successful theater campaigns and December had the least. So it's good to say that the Play should be launched during May or June.
- Knowing the right time to launch the campaign is very important for it to be successful.
- We can also consider the duration or length of the campaign is also important to analyze.
